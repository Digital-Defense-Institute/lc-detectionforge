          <h2>Welcome to DetectionForge</h2>
          <p>
            DetectionForge is a comprehensive detection engineering environment designed to
            streamline the development, testing, and deployment of
            <a href="https://limacharlie.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >LimaCharlie</a
            >
            detection rules. Built for security engineers and analysts, it provides an intuitive
            interface for crafting effective detection logic and validating it against real-world
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            This app is a 100% client-side Single-Page Application (SPA), ensuring that all data
            processing occurs within your browser. Your configuration data (organizations, rules,
            settings) is stored locally in your browser only, while sensitive credentials remain in
            memory and are never persisted. All API interactions communicate directly with
            LimaCharlie API without any intermediary servers. You could even build the app locally
            and host it on your own system.

          <h2>üîß Prerequisites & Setup</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Requirements:</strong> Active LimaCharlie account with API access, at least one
            organization with detection rule permissions, and API credentials (OID, UID, API Key)
            with appropriate permissions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Security:</strong> Credentials are handled entirely in memory within this
            browser tab, so they are not stored persistently anywhere. This dynamic approach ensures
            that sensitive data remains ephemeral and is only available during an active session,
            greatly enhancing security for production environments. Always follow your
            organization's security policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Open Source:</strong> DetectionForge is open source software available on
            <a href="https://github.com/Digital-Defense-Institute/lc-detectionforge" target="_blank"
              >GitHub</a

            security.
